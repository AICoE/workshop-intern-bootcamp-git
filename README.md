Follow along using the documents in this repository to see the exact commands and URLs you need to use in this workshop. You can copy and paste commands you see `in gray` into the terminal or URLS into the browser.

## Tips!

If you get lost in your terminal, the following will help you:

`cd ~` takes you back to your home directory.

`cd ~/<repo>`, where `<repo>` is the name of your repo, takes you inside your local git repo, assuming you cloned it into your home directory.

`ls` lists all the files and folders in the current directory.

`pwd` prints the name and path of the current directory.
